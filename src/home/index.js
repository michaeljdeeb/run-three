  <div>
    <h1>Run3</h1>
    <p>
      Run3 is an interactive way to pace yourself as you begin running.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of having to balance managing a time table and the elapsed time of your workout, Run3 will simply tell you what to do and for how long. This allows you to just focus on having a great workout.
    </p>
    <p>
      The app is best used with a treadmill.
    </p>
  </div>

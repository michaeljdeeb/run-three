    <h1>Run Three</h1>
    <p>
      Run Three is a more interactive version of the various "Couch to 5k" time tables out there. Empowering you to just focus on running instead of having to keep track of elapsed time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Due to this being a web app and not a native app, the following limitations exist:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The web app must stay open and your phone unlocked the whole time. Pick your music playlist and finish texting people beforehand.</li>
      <li>On iOS, adding to the home screen should be done before starting as data stored by the web app cannot be shared with the home screen version.</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

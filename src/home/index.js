    <p>
      Run3 is an interactive way to pace yourself as you being running.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of having to watch a time table on your device and the elapsed time on the treadmill, Run3 will simply tell you what to do and for how long. This empowers you to just focus on having a great workout.
    </p>
    <p>
      The app is best used with a treadmill.
    </p>
  </div>
